A company pays its employees on a weekly basis.
There are two types of employees: salaried employees and hourly employees.

* Salaried employees receive a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of hours worked.
* Hourly employees receive an hourly wage and are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week.

The company wants to develop a Java application that calculates the total amount of payroll to be paid for the current month.
The application should also generate individual settlements for each employee, displaying the detailed breakdown of their earnings.

Additionally, the company plans to enhance the application by introducing two new types of employees.
The first type is commission-based employees who earn a percentage of their sales.
The second type is salary plus commission employees who receive a base salary in addition to a percentage of their sales.

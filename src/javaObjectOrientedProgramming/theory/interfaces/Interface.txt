In Java, an interface is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods that a class must implement.
It acts as a contract, specifying the behavior that implementing classes must adhere to.
An interface can also include constant fields, default methods, and static methods.
By implementing an interface, a class explicitly agrees to fulfill the contract defined by the interface,
which means it must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
This enforces a consistent behavior across different classes implementing the same interface.

1. Declaration:
   Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword.
   For example:

   public interface MyInterface {
       // Abstract method declaration
       void myMethod();
   }

2. Abstract Methods:
   Interfaces declare abstract methods without providing an implementation.
   Any class implementing the interface must override these methods and provide their own implementation.

3. Static Methods:
   Interfaces can have static methods, which can be called directly on the interface itself, without the need for an implementing class instance.
   For example:

   public interface MyInterface{
    public void static myStaticMethod(){
        // Static method implementation
    }
   }

4. Default Methods:
   Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also have default methods.
   These methods have an implementation defined in the interface itself.
   Implementing classes can use the default implementation or override it if needed.
   For example:

   public interface MyInterface {
       default void myMethod() {
           // Default method implementation
       }
   }

5. Multiple Inheritance:
   Java interfaces support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
   This enables a class to inherit and define behavior from multiple sources.

6. Polymorphism: Interfaces facilitate polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface type.
   This provides flexibility and allows for interchangeable usage of different implementations.

7. Implementing an Interface:
   A class can implement one or more interfaces using the implements keyword. It must provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
   For example:

    public class AClass implements AInterface {
        // implementation of the interface methods
        public void myMethod() {
            // Implementation of the method
        }
    }
